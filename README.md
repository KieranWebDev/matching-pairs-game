## Project Details

- A pelmanism game I created by following a Udemy Course. 
- It allowed me to get some practice and reps in with UseState and useEffect. 
- Also introduced a couple of CSS properties that I hadnâ€™t encountered before, such as transform and transition, as well as a bit of practice with CSS Grid. 
- The logic used to shuffle the cards was interesting. I think it was the first time that I had encountered the .sort method
- The UseEffect hook was used to compare the players choices. I had previously only used UseEffect for fetching data, so it was interesting to see it used in this way. 
- I also used React Helmet to add a favicon and title to the page.
